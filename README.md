Analysis of regional and temporal patterns in seine fishing of the landings in Continental Portugal


In Portugal, small and medium pelagic species such as sardine (Sardina pilchardus), chub-mackerel (Scomber colias), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) are the most landed species in the purse seine fishery, accounting for near 50% of total landings in weight.
Historically, sardine has been the target species of the fishery and traditionally perceived as the most important species in the fleet. With severe restrictions on sardine annual catches since 2011, landings profiles have changed.
In annual basis, each purse-seiner can land to 180 day per year such as maximum number of fishing days per year and weekend fishing bans (limits on fishing effort), time and area closures, and daily landing limits (North of Peniche) were taken in place. Daily landings occur from Monday to Saturday along Portuguese mainland and there's 13 ports. This fleet is composed by 2 types of vessels: the big ones, called in Portuguese "traineiras", with length overall bigger than 16 meters and the smaller ones, called "Tucas", measuring between 9 and 16 meters.
The main goal of the project is to analyse the regional and temporal patterns in the landings of pelagic fish, using official landings data from the purse seine fishing fleet. To assist in this analysis, a graphical application in the R environment was developed.
